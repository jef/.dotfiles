# dotfiles

## Getting started

- Install [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
- Run `curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jef/dotfiles/main/.zsh/install.sh | bash` then restart terminal
- Run `zgenom update` then restart terminal

At this point, everything should be ready to go. [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com) should be installed and ready to use as well.

Have fun! :wave:
